## Introduction
Hello fellow gamesdesigners, let me introduce myself. My name is Nicholas Street and I'm a student at staffordshire univercity studying GamesDesign and Programming. In this website I will show you the projects that I've done through college , Univercity and Independently which I'm proud of showing you. My aim during the end of my 2nd year in Uni is to get a intership in the gaming industry. 

## College : Coventry College
I went to Coventry college for a total of 4 years starting from level 1 upwards learning the basics they working my way up honing my skills of being a gamesdesigner. Through the first year through I hardly learnt anything to do with games only using a little bit of game maker preping me for the next year. For the remaining 3 years I worked on various engienes gamemaker and Unreal engine 4 which in each engine I needed to carfully constuct a game that is in response to a brief.

2D game development
Through this course it is the frist time me learning how the industry works and I know that it is hard to get into but I mainly focused on getting better being the best that I can be so that future employers could notice me. To start off with I only used a bit of game maker through the first year but now it has gotten hard I had to respond to a brief where I had to make my own genre game but it needs to have an engaging story and that is what the 2D game production comes in, for me to design a story that has depth and entertainment for the game.

2D Game Production
The story that I wanted to created is based is current time where he is a hired assassin that worked for the boss for a couple of years, however the boss betrayed him so he destroyed his house with his family inside and the main character is set out to take revenge of the boss and his robot minions. At this current time I never had a strong idea of a game that I wanted to make due to the skills and the mechanics that I would need to make and the whole coding of this is drag a drop so I had limitations of what I could do or can't do but never the less I became successful.

# 3rd Year  Started: 2018  Ended: 2019 

Digital Games Production 
1st year
through this I took 1 year to perfect corrently through the industry standard. Through the first year I mainly did the plaining stages of making a game that is response to the brief which is to make a Forenstic sinceist game and create persific mechanics, simple inventory system, pick up and drag objects and finally making the area look realistic to have in a crime scene. The planning stage wasn't diffcult at all I was speeding through the plans because I knew what extact to make main because I played some detective games like L.A.Noire and NCIS crime scene and those two game were my inperation so then I could converg the two together and make a game out of that. Through the planning stages I had to plan through everything  that is going to be in my level that I'm going to make by hand which was related to my 3D modeling and 3D environments work.

3D modeling
1st Year 
Through creating my models to make it look like the inside of a house I needed to make a list and divide each model by the highiest polly model and models that I could do in a couple of hours. Mainly I researched on common items that would be in a middle class house so that the player knows that it is in a house environment and I split areas of what to focus on for every couple of weeks like the Kitchen, Bathroom, Bedroom and Living Room as I created these I looked into the games Designer role of where everything would go and where it would make sense for areas of the environment to go.

3D environments
1st Year 
I made a plan of what would my level look like and do my 3D environmet role by making a 3D version of it then I would go to my games design role and rearange and plan where everything need to go.

Games Testing 
1st year 
through the finished product of my game I would test the functionality of the game and see if my game is playable through critizing my work and noticing more bugs in the game giving me time to fixed them through the minor major critical and show stoppers mainly focusing on the majors, ciritals and show stoppers frist because that would affect the gameplay of the player and it wouldn't class as a working functional game.

## Univercity: Staffordshire Univercity
 A new experience in my life and I've just began through the first year of my education studying Games Design and programming I knew I wanted to mainly design games from the inside out or doing job roles of that either the games design side or the progamming so during the gaming industry say if I'm starting from a QA tester. Through this I would start from the bottom and work my way up or just get the persific roles and help members of my team through the production of the game.

  3D games Engine Creation
  Simester 1
  I was living the role as a level design where I make a level for a game, Unreal Tornament and using the assets that Unreal Tornament has through planning stages of pre-  production , post production and production stages before I start to make the level and my idea was something that students from the past years didn't make it quite successful and I was pre-paired for the challenge, a spaceship.  At first no body liked the idea of my level and aranges that they have suggested I took into consideration and took harsh cirtisasm through the level and I progressed on. 
  
  Simester 2 
  I started to now make my own game using Unreal engine 4 that is in response to the brief of making a puzzle game using blueprints and what I made inspired me through a jam that I wanted to do but I through it would be difficult a game Jam that would make mechanics from a 2D game to a 3D game or visevisa so I made an escape goat style game where pices of the platforms move and the player presses or moves an object to move to a different area of the level but into a simulator. 
  
  
  Rapid Games Prototyping
  
  Simester 1 
  I was living a role as a core GamesDesiger where I get to design and create a prototype level of a plan of what the game is going to look like for this simester I was making a game that has an unique traight like gameplay and mechanic so what I made it a prtotype that can't jump only move left to right and to navigate through the level the character has a rope that can be attached and reattached to any collider through the level. 
  
  
  Simester 2
  Making a game that is in response to the brief which was making a top down shooter with enemies and a boss. This was also difficult of making but I made a top down shooter with a theme where that you are the power souce of the whole level, instantly I throught of a battery and to maniplate that is the character is player as an actual battery where to open doors for do an action they lose one bar of their engry, their health so the player would have to focus on their health as well as their progression. 
  
  Games Design 
  
  Simester 1 
  Learning the analasis of games like blackouts, UI layouts , balance, gameplay patterns and  Gameplay areas unlocked. Through the process of games I've seen more background of being a games design of the process that they would have to consider and go through to make the project entertaining. I also made an Escape goat level making it feel and look like apart of the level as well I linked this to my 3D engine work giving a layout out plan of what my level is going to look like and with this made it even more a success. I also created Doom style game that the Uni has provided me and making peperation of the game based on what I've learnt so far.  
  
  Simester 2 
  learning the same as simester one but more advance such as balance what would the gameplay do if a weapon or a mechanic would be overpowering or weaker that the game the target audience would get bored or find it worthless thing to have so they won't play it again it needs to be more of a challenge but enough for the player to procress through the level. I did the same method of planning through my 3D engine project put this one is through simester 2 so I understand the planning and production process of the work through a games designers perpective.
